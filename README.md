# GitHub Activity CLI

## Overview

This project allows you to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user from the command line using the GitHub API. The application takes a GitHub username as an argument, fetches the user’s recent activity (such as commits, pull requests, and issues), and displays it in the terminal.

This project is designed to help you practice working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a simple command-line interface (CLI) application.

## Features

- Accepts a GitHub username as a command-line argument.
- Fetches recent activity data from GitHub using the GitHub API.
- Displays the user's activity in a readable format.
- Handles API errors, such as invalid usernames or network issues.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (for making HTTP requests to the GitHub API)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-activity-cli.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd github-activity-cli
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   If you don't have `requests` installed yet, you can install it manually:

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

## Usage

To run the CLI and fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user, use the following command:

```bash
python github_activity.py <github_username>
```

Replace `<github_username>` with the actual GitHub username of the person whose activity you want to fetch.

### Example:

```bash
python github_activity.py octocat
```

This will fetch and display the recent activity of the GitHub user "octocat".

### Output Format:

The output will show the user’s recent activities in a readable format, including recent commits, pull requests, and issues.

```bash
Recent Activity for octocat:

1. Commit: Fixed bug in homepage component
   Date: 2025-01-10T12:34:56Z
   Repository: homepage-repo

2. Pull Request: Add new feature for user login
   Date: 2025-01-08T14:20:10Z
   Repository: user-auth

3. Issue: Unable to upload profile picture
   Date: 2025-01-07T10:15:22Z
   Repository: profile-pic-repo
```

## Error Handling

- If you provide an invalid GitHub username, the CLI will inform you that the user was not found.
- If there’s a problem with the GitHub API or network, an error message will be displayed.
